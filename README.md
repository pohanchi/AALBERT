# AALBERT
Here is the official Pytorch lightning reimplementation of the paper, [Audio ALBERT: A Lite Bert for Self-Supervised Learning of Audio Representation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9383575). The original code is in [AlbertNew branch](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl/tree/AlbertNew) of [s3prl](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) repo. In the paper, we proposed Audio ALBERT, which achieves performance comparable with massive pre-trained networks in the downstream tasks while having 91% fewer parameters.
