# AALBERT
Here is the official Pytorch lightning reimplementation of the paper, [Audio ALBERT: A Lite Bert for Self-Supervised Learning of Audio Representation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9383575). In the paper, we proposed Audio ALBERT, which achieves performance comparable with massive pre-trained networks in the downstream tasks while having 91% fewer parameters.
